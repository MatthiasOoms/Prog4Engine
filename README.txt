I don't really know what to write here, this is the Engine we made for Prog4.
It uses Components that get added to GameObjects in order to create specific features.
It has a pImpledSound system, makes use of Observers and Subjects, and uses the Singleton Pattern too.
For input we use Commands, and we have some pImpled Controller input
It can render images and text and it uses Scenes.
